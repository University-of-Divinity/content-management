<h3>QILT Surveys</h3>
<p>The Student Experience Survey is now open! By contributing your views and
experiences, you're helping improve higher education for everyone - including
current and future students. The survey is <a
href="https://insights.srcentre.com.au/mrIWeb/mrIWeb.dll?I.Project=SRC2504AUTH">running online</a> from 28/07/2020 to 30/08/2020.</p>

<h2>Student Surveys</h2>
<p>During your studies, you'll have regular
opportunities to have a say in your learning experience, through the Student
Unit Evaluation online survey. We are committed to listening to your feedback
and informing you of the results as we improve unit content and delivery.</p>
<p>The Semester 1 survey opportunity is coming up shortly. You will receive a
link in ARK to a survey on your experience in your units. Keep an eye out for
emails through ARK from 31 May which will let you know when the survey is
available for your unit.</p>
<p>In the comments section of the survey, you can
take the opportunity to give us feedback in relation to your experience of
transitioning and thriving in online learning during the Coronavirus
restrictions. For example, what was your learning experience in comparison to a
face-to-face classroom? Did you have access to the resources you need on ARK
and the Library Hub? Did the experience of online learning meet your
expectations in communication and interactivity with staff and students?</p>
