    <h2>Upcoming Maintenance</h2><p>Planned maintenance has been scheduled for Wednesday 8 April 2020 between the hours of 5pm and 11pm AEST which will result in some university application systems being unavailable during this time. Although maintenance upgrades are restricted to within the Paradigm (TAMS) system, due to central authentication of university systems, the planned outage will mean that users will not be able to log into Paradigm, ARK and the Library Hub.</p>
-->
<h2>Update for Zoom users</h2>
<p>Before the 30th May, all Zoom users will need to update the app to be on
version 5.0 or higher. Otherwise, you will not be able to join a meeting.

<h2>Student Surveys</h2>
<p>During your studies, you'll have regular
opportunities to have a say in your learning experience, through the Student
Unit Evaluation online survey. We are committed to listening to your feedback
and informing you of the results as we improve unit content and delivery.</p>
<p>The Semester 1 survey opportunity is coming up shortly. You will receive a
link in ARK to a survey on your experience in your units. Keep an eye out for
emails through ARK from 31 May which will let you know when the survey is
available for your unit.</p>
<p>In the comments section of the survey, you can
take the opportunity to give us feedback in relation to your experience of
transitioning and thriving in online learning during the Coronavirus
restrictions. For example, what was your learning experience in comparison to a
face-to-face classroom? Did you have access to the resources you need on ARK
and the Library Hub? Did the experience of online learning meet your
expectations in communication and interactivity with staff and students?</p>

<h2> Code of Conduct</h2>
<p>The University of Divinity has a new Code of
Conduct. The Code of Conduct applies to all members of the University when on
University or College premises, using University or College facilities and
